WIS Site Documentation by Gabe and Manjot
List of Roles and Permissions / Abilities
When anyone visits our site we will have all types of users. These users will be grouped up within three groups:
•	Anonymous Users: Whom have not logged into the site and can only view the content and have no power to change content. 
•	Authenticated Users: Whom have made an account are now logged into their respective account and they will have some privileges that will be discussed below. 
•	Administrative Users: This will be our accounts on the site that have been working on the content management machine. We will have full access to every aspect of the site. 
Springing off the three different types of users that we can have we will now discuss the different roles on our WIS site. 
	A NJIT Student role that allows students to edit their own student page and upload meaningful content. 
	The Administrator role that was installed with our site, for expert users to manage the site configurations.
	A Content editor role that updates event/meeting information when it is readily available to the public.
